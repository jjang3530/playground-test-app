# Jay Jang tasks using Angular 12 

### Basic Tasks:

* [ ] Create a patient view with patients fetched from `test url`. The patients should be sorted by name & birthdate (if a birthdate is in the record). 

* [ ] Display the first & last names, birthdate, address, gender & phone number.
 
* [ ] Ensure the table is responsive. Ensure there is proper error handling for missing elements in the data.

* [ ] Time the request. Output the time on the footer of the page in a human readable format.

* [ ] Add a search function to the page. Add two inputs to your view - one for first name, and one for last name.  Make an API call to `URL` that searches for a `Patient` based on the names passed in. Replace `<userinput>` with the data from the inputs. If only one name is entered in the inputs, modify the query to only use either the first or last name entered.

* [ ] Add a function to reset the search results in the table.

* [ ] Apply validation to the inputs - the boxes cannot contain non-alphabetic characters.

* [ ] Commit your work.
